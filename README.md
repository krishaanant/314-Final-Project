## Stroke Prediction Project
We produced a confusion matrix plot as a product of the logistic regression model we trained.

We also generated a 2-D visualization of the data using the two principal components generated by PCA.

Lastly, we selected two most important features from the first principal component and generated a scatterplot. The two features are age and average glucose level. 


The plots can be found in stroke/plots folder. 

The code can be found in project.py file inside stroke/src/stroke folder.
